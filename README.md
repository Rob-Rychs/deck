# Deckvelop

This repo started out with SMASHING MAGAZINES 2017 CSS GRID CHALLENGE CONTEST WINNER by James Clarke titled Deck

It features a no-JS SPA design using HTML5 and CSS3 only. It breaks gracefully. It's Super lightweight. Uses a nice animation between slides. This webiste makes a super quick, performant and beautiful portfolio or showcase gallery for artists or designers.

Currently the navmenu styles on desktop make it work well with up to ~>17 slides or so. If your gonna add more you'll need to adjust the styles.

Fun to hack apart for learning and it's relatively easy to extend.

Features I've added:

- Back button for slide navigation
- Register a SW for offline support (implemented with [UpUp](https://github.com/TalAter/UpUp) )

Features I'm gonna add:

- Swap out some of the default content
- add a web manifest file

TODO:

- change the .footer content

The ultimate Goal with this repo is to publish a shippable SPA project/portfolio site with a perfect 400/400 score on a lighthouse web app audit.
