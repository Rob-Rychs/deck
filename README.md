This repo started out with SMASHING MAGAZINES 2017 CSS GRID CHALLENGE CONTEST WINNER by James Clarke

It features a no-JS SPA design using HTML5 and CSS3 only. It breaks gracefully. It's Super lightweight. Uses a nice animation between slides.

Currently the navmenu styles on desktop make it work well with ~>17 slides or so. If your gonna add more you'll need to adjust the styles. Fun to hack apart for learning and it's relatively easy to extend.

Features I've added:
- Back button for slide navigation (double check bgcolor)

Features I'm gonna add:
- Swap out the default content
- Register a SW for offline support
- add a web manifest file

The ultimate Goal with this repo is to publish a shippable SPA project/portfolio site with a perfect 400/400 score on a lighthouse web app audit.
