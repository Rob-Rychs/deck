SMASHING MAGAZINES 2017 CSS GRID CHALLENGE CONTEST WINNER by James Clarke

Features a no JS SPA design using HTML5 and CSS3 only. Breaks gracefully. Super lightweight. Nice animations between slides. Currently the navmenu styles on desktop make it work well with ~17 slides or so. If your gonna add more you'll need to adjust the styles. Fun to hack apart for learning and relatively easy to extend.
